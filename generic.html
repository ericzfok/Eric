								One of my biggest classes is SM 131. It is the business and ethics class that is required for all Questrom students. On the left, it is a picture of my SM team right after we presented our first presentation. I was lucky to have such a great group that works hard and strives for great goals.</p>

								<p>Up next, is our second presentation that is due the Monday that students return from Thanksgiving break. My team and I are putting the finishing touches on our second presentation and must start practicing to succeed in our second presentation.  </p>

								From the pledge process so far, I can definitely say that I've learned so much professionally. The classes we have and assignments taught me a lot. One of the great parts of the pledge process so far would be retreat. The retreat brought our class to be closer and we had a great time.</p>

								One of the first clubs I decided to join at BU was CSA since it was a good way for me to meet more people and embrace my culture. Unfortunately, I have not been to many CSA events due to other committments. But, I do look forward to other events in the future.</p>

								<p>On the picture on the left, it was day of the big/little reveal. I got a great big, Sydney, and a great twin, Stephanie.  </p>
